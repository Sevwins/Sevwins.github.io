1. **Accounts**

    1.1 **Account Creation.** In order to use certain features of the Site, you must register for an account (“**Account**”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the account registration form.  You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information.

2. **Billing**

    2.1 **Payment.** You can add paid features to your account (turning your account into a “**Paid Account**”). Paid Account holders, or “ **Subscribers,”** will provide Sevwins with a valid and updated credit card for payment of the applicable fees. The Subscriber authorizes Sevwins to charge such credit card for all purchased services. In addition to any fees, the Subscriber may still incur charges incidental to using the Service, for example, charges for Internet access, data roaming, and other data transmission charges.

    2.2 **Taxes.** All fees are exclusive of all federal, state, provincial, municipal, or other taxes which Subscribers agrees to pay based on where the Subscriber is located.

    2.3 **Overdue Charges.** If Subscriber does not supply valid, updated, or timely payment for the purchased services, without limiting any legal rights or remedies, your account may be suspended or terminated, and access to any content, purchased or otherwise, may be blocked until payment is satisfied in full.

    2.4 **Termination.** You’re free to stop using your Paid Account at any time. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features. We also reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Paid Account with notice to you if:

      (a) you’re in breach of these Terms,

      (b) your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or

      (c) you downgraded from a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 months.

There are no charges for cancelling a subscription and paying subscriptions cancelled prior to the end of their current billing cycle will not be charged again in the following cycle. If you’re on an annual plan, we’ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You’re responsible for all taxes that are applicable to your purchased subscription, and we’ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws.

    3.2 **Subscription Services.**  ** Your subscription will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. The amount charged on the next billing cycle will be automatically updated to reflect any changes to the subscription, including upgrades or downgrades. Adding any subscription upgrades will trigger prorated charges in the current billing cycle. Subscriber authorizes Sevwins to apply updated charge amounts. Subscription changes, including downgrades, may result in loss of access to Content, features, or an increase or reduction in the amount of available capacity for Content provided by the Service. There are no charges for cancelling a subscription and paying subscriptions cancelled prior to the end of their current billing cycle will not be charged again in the following cycle.

    3.3 **Trial Periods.** Subscriptions cancelled prior to the expiration of any trial period, will not be charged. Subscribers will thereafter be charged in advance each 30 days or yearly which will be determined by the period selected upon subscription to the free trial.** **

    3.4 **No Refunds.** You may cancel your Paid Account at any time. However, all charges are final and non-refundable, including payments made towards subscription, setup fees, and other professional services charges. No refunds or credits will be issued for partial periods of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for periods unused with an active subscription, including, but not limited to, instances involving the removal of a Subscriber. Refunds for any other expense will only be issued to the extent they are mandated by law.

    3.5 **Changes.** We may change the fees in effect but will give you notice of these changes via a message to the information associated with your account.

    3.6 **Notice.** We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the personal information associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you.  If after such notice you fail to take the steps asked, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the account. No notice will be provided before termination where:

      (a) you’re in material breach of these Terms,

      (b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the services to our other users, or

      (c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.

    11.2 **Dispute Resolution. _Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.  It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER._**

      (a) _Applicability of Arbitration Agreement._  All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.

      (b)_Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution_.  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (**“Notice”**) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 2 Avenue de Lafayette, 4th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.  After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

      (c) Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (**“ADR Provider”**) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (**“Arbitration Rules”**) governing the arbitration are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

      (d) _Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration_.  If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

      (e) _Time Limits._  If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

      (f) _Authority of Arbitrator_.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.

      (g) _Waiver of Jury Trial._  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

      (h) _Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions_.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  

      (i) _Confidentiality_.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

      (j) _Severability_.  If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

      (k) _Right to Waive._  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.

      (l) _Survival of Agreement_.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.  

      (m) _Small Claims Court._  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.

      (n) _Emergency Equitable Relief_.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

      (o) _Claims Not Subject to Arbitration._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

      (p) _Courts._  In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Suffolk County, Massachusetts, for such purpose

    11.3 **Export.** The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

    11.5 **Electronic Communications.**  The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.

    11.6 **Entire Terms.** These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”.  If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Company may freely assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
